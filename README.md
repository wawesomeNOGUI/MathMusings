# Quotes
- "All of these different applications of the derivative illustrate the fact that part of the power of mathematics lies in its abstractness. A single abstract mathematical concept (such as the derivative) can have different interpretations in each of the sciences. When we develop the properties of the mathematical concept once and for all, we can then turn around and apply these results to all of the sciences. This is much more efficient than developing properties of special concepts in each separate science. The French mathematician Joseph Fourier (1768–1830) put it succinctly: “Mathematics compares the most diverse phenomena and discovers the secret analogies that unite them.”"
-James Stewart, Calculus 9E

- "Some calculus-tricks are quite easy. Some are enormously difficult. The fools who write the textbooks of advanced mathematics ... seem to desire to impress you with their tremendous cleverness by going about it in the most difficult way. Being myself a remarkably stupid fellow, I have had to unteach myself the difficulties, and now beg to present to my fellow fools the parts that are not hard. Master these thoroughly, and the rest will follow. What one fool can do, another can."
-Silvanus P. Thompson, Calculus Made Easy
